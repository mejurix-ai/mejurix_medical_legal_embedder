## Observations

1. **Effect of NER-based Embedding**:
   - Effectively captures core entities in medical/legal contexts through named entity recognition
   - Generates differentiated embeddings by relationship type compared to traditional embedding models

2. **Training Specifics**:
   - Some errors occurred during the training process (missing 'save_pretrained' method)
   - Achieved competitive performance despite limited training time (approximately 4 minutes 20 seconds)
   - Hard negative mining contributed to improving the model's discrimination capabilities

3. **Performance Analysis**:
   - High similarity scores in medical relationship types (DISEASE_MEDICATION, SEVERITY_PROGNOSIS)
   - Stable performance maintained in legal-related relationship types
   - Overall relationship type average similarity achieved a high level of 0.8168

## Conclusions and Future Improvement Directions

1. **Key Success Factors**:
   - Enhanced contextual information through NER-based approach
   - Prevention of overfitting through appropriate dropout (0.5)
   - Increased training efficiency through hard negative mining

2. **Improvement Possibilities**:
   - Need to improve model saving mechanism (currently encountering 'save_pretrained' errors)
   - Potential for performance improvement through extended training time
   - Need to secure balanced training data for more diverse relationship types

3. **Application Possibilities**:
   - Effective for understanding semantic similarities between medical-legal documents
   - Can be utilized for real case analysis by integrating with PDF document embedding and visualization tools
   - Potential to develop into specialized models for specific domains (medical or legal) through future fine-tuning

This model demonstrates the effectiveness of the NER-based approach and shows competitive performance as an embedding model for the medical-legal domain. Although there were some technical issues during the training process, the final model provides balanced performance across various relationship types and has reached a level suitable for practical applications.
